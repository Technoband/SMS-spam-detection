# SMS Spam Detection Project

![SMS Spam Detection]

## Overview

This repository contains the codebase for an SMS Spam Detection project, which is part of the Bharat Intern internship. The goal of this project is to develop a robust and accurate system for identifying and classifying SMS messages as either spam or legitimate.

## Key Features

- **Machine Learning Models:** Implementation of state-of-the-art machine learning models for text classification, trained on a diverse dataset of SMS messages.
  
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Utilization of NLP techniques to extract relevant features and patterns from text data, enhancing the model's ability to differentiate between spam and non-spam messages.

- **Evaluation Metrics:** Comprehensive evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score are incorporated to assess the performance of the models accurately.

- **User-friendly Interface:** Integration of an intuitive user interface for easy interaction with the spam detection system.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd SMS-Spam-Detection-Project
   ```


## Dataset

The model is trained on a diverse dataset containing labeled SMS messages, with a balanced distribution of spam and non-spam examples.
